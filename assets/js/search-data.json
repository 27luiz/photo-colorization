We took Jason Antic&#39;s De-Oldify code which is a deep learning based project for restoring old images. In case you&#39;re not familiar with deep learning, it is a field within machine learning which mimics the human brain. Deep learning is the creation of a multi neural network architecture that is trained with millions of data points. This exercise demonstrates a fantastic application of the power of using deep learning. . Dal&#237; . The caption for this image is &quot;Dalí dans l&#39;eau, Port-Lligat (Jean Dieuzaide, 1953)&quot; which translates to Dalí in the water, Port-Lligat.

I wonder if the flowers were actually this soft pink color. .",
